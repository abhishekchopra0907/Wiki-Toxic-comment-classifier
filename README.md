# Wiki-Toxic-comment-classifier
# What is it ?
This basically a model which classifies toxic wikipedia comments into 6 classes bases on how toxic they are
# Why ?
Being anonymous over the internet can sometimes make people say nasty things that they normally would not in real life. Let's filter out the hate from our platforms one comment at a time.
# How does it work ?
Basically this contains 2 NLP models-
  * a normal deep nueral network to classify our tokenised comments 
  * a LSTM  with one dense layer to classify our tokenised comments
